# Startup Template
Small template I use to start my Rails projects. Uses the following:
- User authentication from scratch following [Railscasts #250][http://railscasts.com/episodes/250-authentication-from-scratch]
- Nifty generated scaffolding
- Pages controller, with Home page as default root.
- Harry Roberts's [HTML5 Boilerplate][http://csswizardry.com/2011/01/the-real-html5-boilerplate/] (with Eric Meyer CSS Reset)
- and more to be added...
